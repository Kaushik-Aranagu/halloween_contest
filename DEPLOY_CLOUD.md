### Important Notes for Render:

⚠️ **Free tier limitations:**
- App "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- 750 hours/month (enough for one event)

💡 **Tip:** Keep the app "awake" during your party by:
- Having someone refresh the page every 10 minutes, OR
- Using a free uptime monitor like UptimeRobot.com

## 🚂 Option 2: Railway.app

### Why Railway?
- ✅ Very fast deployment

1. **Go to Railway:** https://railway.app
2. **Sign up** with GitHub
3. Click **"New Project"** → **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**

5. Railway auto-detects Flask and deploys!
6. Add a domain: Click **"Settings"** → **"Generate Domain"**

**Done!** Your URL: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

### Important Notes for Railway:

⚠️ **$5 credit = ~5GB outbound bandwidth**
- Should be plenty for a small party
- Monitor usage at dashboard.railway.app

## 🔄 Updating Your Deployed App

When you make changes:

### For Render/Railway:
1. Commit changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update app"
   git push
   ```
2. Render/Railway auto-deploys!

### For PythonAnywhere:
1. Upload modified files through the web interface
2. Click "Reload" on Web tab

---

## 🎨 Customizing the QR Code for Cloud URL

After deployment, update your QR code:

```python
# Edit generate_qr.py - change this line:
url = "https://your-deployed-app-url.com"

# Then run:
python generate_qr.py
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Cloud Deployment

### "Build Failed" Error
**Solution:** Check the build logs on Render/Railway dashboard
- Usually means missing dependencies
- Make sure `requirements.txt` is correct

### "Application Error" or 500 Error
**Solution:** 
1. Check logs in the dashboard
2. Make sure `gunicorn` is in requirements.txt
3. Verify all files uploaded correctly

### Images Not Loading
**Problem:** Uploaded images disappear after redeployment

**Solution for Render:** Use external storage
- Option A: Store in a persistent volume (Render paid feature)
- Option B: Use Cloudinary (free tier) for image hosting
- Option C: For one-time event, don't redeploy after images are uploaded

### App is Slow to Wake Up (Render)
**Solution:** 
- Use UptimeRobot to ping your app every 10 minutes
- Or upgrade to paid tier ($7/month for no sleep)
- Or use Railway instead (no sleep with $5 credit)

### Running Out of Railway Credit
**Solution:**
- Check usage at dashboard.railway.app
- Reduce image sizes (add compression)
- Or switch to Render for longer events

## 💰 Cost Comparison

For a one-night Halloween party:

| Platform | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Render Free** | $0 | Will sleep, but fine for event |
| **Railway** | $0 | $5 credit lasts for event |
| **PythonAnywhere** | $0 | Limited but works |
| **Your Local PC** | $0 | But needs to stay on |

**For your use case (one party, <30 people): Use Render or Railway!**

---

## 🎯 Recommended: Render.com

For your Halloween party, I recommend **Render.com** because:

1. ✅ **Easiest to deploy** (5 minutes)
2. ✅ **Free forever** 
3. ✅ **Reliable** 
4. ✅ **Automatic HTTPS**
5. ✅ **No credit card needed**

The only downside is the 30-second wake-up time after sleeping, but:
- It won't sleep during your active party
- Wake it up before guests arrive
- Optionally use UptimeRobot to keep it awake
